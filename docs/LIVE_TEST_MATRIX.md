# Live Retail acceptance matrix

Source/CI checks cannot fill these rows. Record evidence on the exact addon SHA/version and current Retail build.

## Environment matrix

For each relevant scenario record: date/region, WoW build/interface, resolution, UI scale, language, raid size, RLA version/SHA, DBM version, BigWigs version, and enabled addon set.

Test at minimum:

- 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160 and an ultrawide resolution at representative UI scales.
- English plus at least one non-English client to prove mechanic identity is ID-driven rather than localized-string driven.
- no bossmod; DBM only; BigWigs only; DBM+BigWigs; Blizzard timeline available with each relevant combination.
- clean SavedVariables, upgraded historical SavedVariables and intentionally malformed recoverable SavedVariables.
- raid leader, raid assistant and ordinary member permissions.

## Per boss/difficulty

For every one of 8 bosses x Normal/Heroic/Mythic that is claimed live-ready, verify plan text, assignment layout, call buttons, mechanic/difficulty correctness, visible English copy, provider identities, timing precision, PREPARE/PRESS behavior, deduplication, audio, manual call send, wipe cleanup and next-pull reset.

For every timed mechanic reproduce the occurrence more than once when practical. One successful pull is not enough to prove lifecycle stability.

## Recovery and failure scenarios

- `/reload` before pull, during a supported pull and after wipe.
- disconnect/reconnect where practical.
- bossmod loaded late or disabled.
- provider timer update, pause/resume, cancel/fade and duplicate second-provider arrival.
- permission loss during a scheduled pre-pull briefing.
- combat starts during briefing.
- unsupported encounter, Raid Finder/Story/other unsupported difficulty and unknown context.
- no TTS voice/API available.
- full/long assignment text near Raid Warning limits.

## Taint/performance/accessibility

Capture `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED`/taint errors, Lua errors, CPU/frame-time and memory before pull, during event bursts and after repeated wipes. Run at least a 20-pull/wipe soak sequence for a representative timed encounter and verify no sustained timer/frame/callback/memory growth.

Verify text remains legible, controls do not overlap, PREPARE/PRESS/CALLED are distinguishable without color, long names do not destroy layout, keyboard focus where supported is usable, and critical actions remain understandable under raid time pressure.

## Ula'tek gate

Do not change `timing=false` until live evidence confirms the difficulty split and stable exact public timing identities for the mechanics RLA would consume. Provider drycode or generic Blizzard timeline fallback alone is not sufficient.
